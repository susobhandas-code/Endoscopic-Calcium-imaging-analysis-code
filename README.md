Tiff file analysis recorded from endoscopic calcium imaging experiment

About the endoscpic calcium imaging from mice brain: Endoscopic calcium imaging enables high-resolution recording of neural activity from deep brain structures in behaving animals. This technique employs genetically encoded calcium indicators (such as GCaMP) to detect intracellular calcium transients associated with neuronal activity. A gradient-index (GRIN) lens is surgically implanted to relay fluorescence signals from the targeted brain region to a head-mounted miniature epifluorescence microscope (miniscope). The resulting time-series data allows for the analysis of population dynamics of identified neurons during naturalistic behaviors, offering a powerful approach for dissecting circuit-level mechanisms underlying sensory processing, learning, and decision-making.

TIFF File Info: The tiff is a stack of Images collected at a priticualr frame rate. For my experiment the system captured image with 100 ms exposure.
